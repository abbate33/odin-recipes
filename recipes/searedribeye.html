            <p>Cast Iron Pan Seared 20 oz+ ribeye, with bacon fat, butter, garlic, thyme and rosemary.</p>            
            <p>If you're making steaks inside, you've come to the right place. This technique for cooking steak in a cast iron skillet is unbeatable. What sets it apart? It starts on the stove in a cast iron skillet, but you'll finish the steak in the oven. The stovetop-to-oven method produces steaks with a deeply caramelized crust and a tender, perfectly cooked interior.</p>
